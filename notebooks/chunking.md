| Symbol | Meaning              |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| S      | Sentence             |
| NP     | Noun Phrase          |
| VP     | Verb Phrase          |
| PP     | Prepositional Phrase |
| Det    | Determiner (the, a)  |
| N      | Noun                 |
| V      | Verb                 |
| P      | Preposition          |
| A      | Adjective            |

Example

“The old tree swayed in the wind”

S → NP + VP

NP → Det + Adj + N → The old tree

VP → V + PP → swayed in the wind

These rules are like LEGO instructions for sentences.

What is Syntax (forget NLP for a minute)

Syntax = rules for arranging words

Just like:

Math has rules → 2 + 3, not + 2 3

Programming has rules → if (x > 0)

Language has rules → “The tree swayed”, not “Tree the swayed”

So:

Syntax studies how words combine to form valid sentences

Think structure, not meaning.


2️⃣ Phrase Structure Rules (the grammar blueprint)

These rules describe how sentences are built.

Core rules from the slide
S  → NP VP
NP → Det N | Pro | PN
VP → V (NP) (PP) (Adv)
PP → P NP
AP → A (PP)
